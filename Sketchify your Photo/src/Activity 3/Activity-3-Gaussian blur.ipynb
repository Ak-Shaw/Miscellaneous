    "## Apply a Gaussian blur\n",
    "A Gaussian blur is an effective way to both reduce noise and reduce the amount of detail in an image (also called smoothing an image). Mathematically it is equivalent to convolving an image with a Gaussian kernel. The size of the Gaussian kernel can be passed to cv2.GaussianBlur as an optional argument ksize. If both sigmaX and sigmaY are set to zero, the width of the Gaussian kernel will be derived from ksize.\n",

    "Image blurring is achieved by convolving the image with a low-pass filter kernel. It is useful for removing noise. It actually removes high frequency content (eg: noise, edges) from the image. So edges are blurred a little bit in this operation (there are also blurring techniques which don't blur the edges). OpenCV provides four main types of blurring techniques.\n",

    "Here we will be using Gaussian Blurring.\n",
    "In this method, instead of a box filter, a Gaussian kernel is used. It is done with the function, cv.GaussianBlur(). We should specify the width and height of the kernel which should be positive and odd. We also should specify the standard deviation in the X and Y directions, sigmaX and sigmaY respectively. If only sigmaX is specified, sigmaY is taken as the same as sigmaX. If both are given as zeros, they are calculated from the kernel size. Gaussian blurring is highly effective in removing Gaussian noise from an image."
