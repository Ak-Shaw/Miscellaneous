    "# Understanding Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Before understanding what's linear regression, let us first learn about some key terms that will be used extensively in the further activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Target: It is the feature that we want to predict.\n",
    "2. Error: It is the difference between the actual and the predicted value. It is also referred to as a Residual.\n",
    "3. Cost Function: It defines the total error of the model. It is this function that the model tries to optimize. In the case of Linear Regressionm, it is the mean of the sum of all the errors in the dataset, popularly known as the **mean squared error**.\n",
    "4. Gradient Descent: It tries to find the best set of coefficients which optimizes the Cost Function.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, talking about Linear Regression, it tries to fit a straight line between variables which optimizes the cost function or which explains the maximum variance of the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Equation of the straight line is **y = mx+c** where m is the slope of **x** and **c** is the intercept. This equation follows only when we have one independant feature. As the feature increases, the number of x's increases and the number of slopes increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whole process of Linear Regression can be summarized as:\n",
    "1. Randomly initialise the slopes/coefficients.\n",
    "2. Use Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    ">Calculate Cost<br>\n",
    ">Calculate the slope of the cost function.<br>\n",
    ">Move in the direction of decreasing cost function by calculating the derivative.<br>\n",
    "Update the parameters.<br>\n",
    "Repeat the above steps untill the minimum value of cost function is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was just a quick recap of what a Linear Regression does. If you want to have a detailed study about this algorithm, I have added links to youtube videos under the **Additional Material** at the last of the activity. So, you can have a look to that as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, enough of theory. Let's begin with implementing Linear Regression and see what it can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
