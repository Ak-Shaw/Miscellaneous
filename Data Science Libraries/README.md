# Data Science Libraries

### Python Libraries used for data science are one of the most popular frameworks used by data scientists and software developers alike for data science tasks. It can be used to predict outcomes, automate tasks, streamline processes, and offer business intelligence insights.*

It’s possible to work with data in vanilla Python, but there are quite a few open-source libraries that make Python data tasks much, much easier. 

## Prerequisites

For this micro-task, you should have a basic knowledge of:
* Python
* Data Science

These libraries form the basis of any Machine Learnig Project or Algorithm.

## Activities

**Note:** Remember to go through the additional material provided in the activities to have a more thorough understanding of the underlying concepts.

### Activity 1 - Matplotlib

This is a standard data science library that helps to generate data visualizations such as two-dimensional diagrams and graphs (histograms, scatterplots, non-Cartesian coordinates graphs). Matplotlib is one of those plotting libraries that are really useful in data science projects  it  provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications.

### Activity 2 - Pandas

Pandas is a library created to help developers work with "labeled" and "relational" data intuitively. It's based on two main data structures: "Series" (one-dimensional, like a list of items) and "Data Frames" (two-dimensional, like a table with multiple columns). Pandas allows converting data structures to DataFrame objects, handling missing data, and adding/deleting columns from DataFrame, imputing missing files, and plotting data with histogram or plot box. It’s a must-have for data wrangling, manipulation, and visualization.

### Activity 3 - Test Yourself

This activity is used to test your knowledege of matplotlib and pandas.

## Summary

Now, you must be confident in the working with Libraries for data science in python. Also, you must be clear in the syntax and its use as an when necessary.
