# Data Science Libraries

**Python is one of the most popular languages used by data scientists and software developers alike for data science tasks. It can be used to predict outcomes, automate tasks, streamline processes, and offer business intelligence insights.**

It’s possible to work with data in vanilla Python, but there are quite a few open-source libraries that make Python data tasks much, much easier.

You’ve certainly heard of some of these, but is there a helpful library you might be missing? Here's a line-up of the most important Python libraries for data science tasks, covering areas such as data processing, modeling, and visualization.

1. **NumPy**
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a perfect tool for scientific computing and performing basic and advanced array operations.

The library offers many handy features performing operations on n-arrays and matrices in Python. It helps to process arrays that store values of the same data type and makes performing math operations on arrays (and their vectorization) easier. In fact, the vectorization of mathematical operations on the NumPy array type increases performance and accelerates the execution time.

2. **SciPy**
This useful library includes modules for linear algebra, integration, optimization, and statistics. Its main functionality was built upon NumPy, so its arrays make use of this library. SciPy works great for all kinds of scientific programming projects (science, mathematics, and engineering). It offers efficient numerical routines such as numerical optimization, integration, and others in submodules. The extensive documentation makes working with this library really easy.

3. **Pandas**
Pandas is a library created to help developers work with "labeled" and "relational" data intuitively. It's based on two main data structures: "Series" (one-dimensional, like a list of items) and "Data Frames" (two-dimensional, like a table with multiple columns). Pandas allows converting data structures to DataFrame objects, handling missing data, and adding/deleting columns from DataFrame, imputing missing files, and plotting data with histogram or plot box. It’s a must-have for data wrangling, manipulation, and visualization.


4. Matplotlib
This is a standard data science library that helps to generate data visualizations such as two-dimensional diagrams and graphs (histograms, scatterplots, non-Cartesian coordinates graphs). Matplotlib is one of those plotting libraries that are really useful in data science projects — it  provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications. 

It's thanks to this library that Python can compete with scientific tools like MatLab or Mathematica. However, developers need to write more code than usual while using this library for generating advanced visualizations. Note that popular plotting libraries work seamlessly with Matplotlib. 

5. **Seaborn**
Seaborn is based on Matplotlib and serves as a useful Python machine learning tool for visualizing statistical models – heatmaps and other types of visualizations that summarize data and depict the overall distributions. When using this library, you get to benefit from an extensive gallery of visualizations (including complex ones like time series, joint plots, and violin diagrams).
